- 👋 Hi, I’m @jsfrade
- 👀 I’m interested in Java, Microservices, Automation
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the implications of various technologies in the real world
- 💞️ I’m looking to meet Engineers who would like to know more about Thales Careers in Portugal
- 📫 How to reach me: joao.frade@thalesgroup.com or on LinkedIn (you'll get to me easily)
- Clearly I'm a GitHub noob since I just completed the standard readme file

Now, talking seriously, I'm here to meet people interested in working in one of the biggest tech groups working in Portugal, and developing state-of-the-art critcal systems

If you are into Space, Aerospace, Defence, Ground Transportation (mainly railways systems), I'm the guy for you to contact for a change in career
